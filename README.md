# DwainesOpenGL3DScene
School project with the goal of learning OpenGL using C++ to create a 3D scene from a picture we took 

I chose this picture 

Which contains My Nintendo Switch, it's dock, a tube of chapstick and a Pokeball. 

Using learnopengl.com and resources from my school, I was able to somewhat recreate my photo

I intend to continue updating it, however, due to the fact that I had trouble mostly with Creating 
vertex data for the spehere and the cylinder, and I didn't properly texture the objects due to time constraints.
